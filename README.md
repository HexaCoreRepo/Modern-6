# Abyss (BETA)

Here is where you'll download Abyss, my first theme. 
As of right now, there is nothing. However, my upcoming first theme is in Pre-Alpha.

*I will release a beta when it is ready.*

To use this theme, you will need a jailbroken iOS device, Filza File Manager and Snowboard. 

*I am **uncertain** if this works with Winterboard or Anemone, as I have not tested them. 

To install, download the theme to your device (on iOS/iPadOS 13.0 or later you can download it with Safari), open it in the Files application. In Files, tap and hold on the .zip file and tap "Share" and "Copy to Filza". Once it opens tap the .zip and it will extract into a folder. Copy the new folder and navigate to /Library/Themes and paste the folder there. 

If you have any issues, open a new issue and I *will* see it!
