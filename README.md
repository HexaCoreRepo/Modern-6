# iOS 6 Retina Teme - Modern 6 (BETA)

Here is where you'll download my iOS 6 Retina theme! 
This *is* my first theme!

No one has released an HD iOS 6 theme in the past few years, and I - among others - would like a new one. That's why I'm bringing you an iOS 6 theme that suits the high quality displays we have now. 

As of right now, iOS icons are in beta. This means that there will be bugs and not all icons are done. 

During this beta period, you should report any bugs that you come across. However, you can also put in requests for third party AppStore apps as well.

To use this theme, you will need a jailbroken iOS device, Filza File Manager and Snowboard. 

*I am **uncertain** if this works with Winterboard or Anemone, as I have not tested them. 

To install: Download the theme to your jailbroken device (on iOS/iPadOS 13.0 or later you can download it with Safari), open it in the Apple Files application. In Files, tap and hold on the .zip file and tap "Share". Then find "Copy to Filza" and select it. Once it opens, tap the .zip and it will extract into a folder. Navigate to the .theme folder within the previous folder. Copy the .theme folder and navigate to /Library/Themes and paste the folder there. 

*If you **do not** have a Themes folder in Library, just add one!*

If you come across any bugs, open a new issue and I *will* see it!
