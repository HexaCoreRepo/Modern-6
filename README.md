# Modern 6 (Beta) - A modern retina iOS 6 theme.

## By - IceCool Tech (YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/c/IceCoolTech)


# Overview

This is my first theme.

No one has made an HD iOS 6 theme in a *long* time - if ever. I, among others, would like a new one. That's why I'm bringing you an iOS 6 theme that is specifically for the modern high quality displays we have now. 

Modern 6 looks **great** with "Six (LS)" from Skittys repo!

# About the beta

As of right now, iOS icons are in beta. This means that there will be bugs and not all icons are done. This also means that some icons may be blurry for the time being. 

During this beta period, you should report any bugs that you come across. However, you can also put in requests for ***popular*** third party App Store apps. These apps must have had an iOS 6 or older specific icon as well.

If you come across any bugs, open a new issue and I *will* see it!

# Requirements & Installation 

**To use this theme, you will need a jailbroken iOS device, Filza File Manager and Snowboard.**

I am *uncertain* if this works with Winterboard or Anemone, as I have not tested them.

To install: Download the theme to your jailbroken device (on iOS/iPadOS 13.0 or later you can download it with Safari), open it in the Apple Files application. In Files, tap and hold on the .zip file and tap "Share". Then find "Copy to Filza" and select it. Once it opens, tap the .zip and it will extract into a folder. Navigate to the .theme folder within the previous folder. Copy the .theme folder and navigate to /Library/Themes and paste the folder there. 

**If you *do not* have a Themes folder in Library, just add one!**
