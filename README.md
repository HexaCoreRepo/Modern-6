# Modern 6 (Beta) - A modern retina iOS 6 theme.

## By - IceCool Tech (YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/c/IceCoolTech)


# Overview

This is my first theme.

No one has made an HD iOS 6 theme in a *long* time - if ever. I, among others, would like a new one. That's why I'm bringing you an iOS 6 theme that is specifically for the modern high quality displays we have now. 

Modern 6 looks **great** with "Six (LS)" from Skittys repo!

# About the beta

As of right now, the theme is in beta. This means that there will be bugs and not all icons are done. This also means that some icons *may* be blurry for the time being. 

During this beta period, you should report any bugs that you come across. However, you can also put in requests for ***popular*** third party App Store apps. These apps must have had an iOS 6 or older specific icon as well.

If you come across any bugs, open a new issue and I *will* see it!

# Requirements & Installation 

**To use this theme, you will need a jailbroken iOS device, Filza File Manager and Snowboard.**

I am *uncertain* if this works with Winterboard or Anemone, as I have not tested them.

To install: 

1) Download the theme to your jailbroken device from the releases tab. On iOS/iPadOS 13.0 or later, you can download it with Safari.
2) Open it in the Apple Files application. 
3) Tap and hold on the .zip file.
4) Tap "Share".
5) Find "Copy to Filza" and select it. 
6) In Filza, tap the .zip and it will extract into a folder.
7) Navigate to the M6 Icons.theme and M6 Badges.theme folders within the previous folder. 
8) Copy both .theme folders.
9) Navigate to /Library/Themes and paste the .theme folders in there. 

**If you *do not* have a Themes folder in Library, just add one!**

# Known issues

# F.A.Q

### When will it come out of beta?

When it's ready.

### Why is it downloading as a folder?

If it downloads as a folder, you are simply using a device that is automatically unzipping the file.

### What do I do if it downloads as a folder?

Follow every step in order, but skip step 6. 

### When will iPhone have full support?

I have not tested the theme yet on iPhone, meaning that I am unsure on what works with iPhone. For example, something like app Badges may only work on iPad right now.
