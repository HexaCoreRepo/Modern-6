# Modern 6 (Beta) - A modern retina iOS 6 theme.

## By - IceCool Tech (YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/c/IceCoolTech)

## No longer being update here! You can install this theme in Cydia or Zebra using the IceCool Tech official repo:


# Overview

This is my first theme.

No one has made an HD iOS 6 theme in a *long* time - if ever. I, among others, would like a new one. That's why I'm bringing you an iOS 6 theme that is specifically for the modern high quality displays we have now. 

Modern 6 looks **great** with "Six (LS)" from Skittys repo and Classic Badges!

# About the beta

As of right now, the theme is in beta. This means that there will be bugs and not all icons are done. This also means that some icons *may* be blurry for the time being. 

During this beta period, you should report any bugs that you come across. However, you can also put in requests for ***popular*** third party App Store apps. These apps must have had an iOS 6 or older specific icon as well.

If you come across any bugs, open a new issue and I *will* see it!

# Requirements & Installation 

**To use this theme, you will need a jailbroken iOS device, Filza File Manager and Snowboard.**

I am *uncertain* if this works with Winterboard or Anemone, as I have not tested them.

To install: 

1) Download the theme to your jailbroken device from the releases tab. On iOS/iPadOS 13.0 or later, you can download it with Safari.
2) Open it in the Apple Files application. 
3) Extract the folder from the .zip file by tapping on the zip.
4) Tap and hold on the folder.
5) Find "Copy to Filza" and select it. 
6) Once in Filza, tap and hold on the "Modern 6" folder and copy it.
7) Navigate to /Library/Themes and paste the folder.
8) Open Settings -> Snowboard -> Select theme -> Enable Modern 6.

**If you *do not* have a Themes folder in Library, just add one!**
